# rssfeed-django

## About
The purpose of this project is to showcase my proficiency in both front-end and back-end developments by presenting a basic RSS feed reader. Initially created as a practice exercise in Python and Django programming, the project has since been expanded to include Bootstrap and JavaScript development.
